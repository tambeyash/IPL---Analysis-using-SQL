# IPL Dataset Analysis Using SQL

In this project we use SQL (SQLite) to perform an analysis on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harsha547/ipldatabase) dataset.

The dataset contains detailed records of venues, players, matches and ball-by-ball data of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) from season 2008-2016.

The Database Schema is as follows:

We use SQL to answer the following questions:

1. No of players in the IPL country wise
2. Number of matches played in each stadium and city
3. Man of the Series, Purple Cap, Orange Cap winners in every season
4. Total matches won by each team
5. Distribution of Wicket types
6. Top 10 run scorers and wicket takers
7. Players with the most Man of the Match
8. Total runs scored and total wickets taken in each over throughout the tournament
